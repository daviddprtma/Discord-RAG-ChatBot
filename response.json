This means that the fastest players to submit a quest receive rewards. In response to user feedback highlighting the challenge of earning rewards and the pressure to quickly complete quests, Learn &amp; Earn is trying out a new reward distribution system. This change is intended to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to earn rewards for their effort and hard work, even if they may not be able to participate right away when a quest launches. <br><br>We want to continue rewarding our very dedicated players who are there at 1200 hrs GMT+8 to start questing, so a portion of the rewards will be reserved for the fastest players. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red80\">The remaining rewards will be distributed via the new mechanism.</span></strong></p>\n<p>For all quests included in this experimental reward mechanism, it will be stated explicitly in the quests\u2019 introduction.\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQMJBZ4KPZ19GS4DD4AA7SCZ\"><strong><br>How it works?\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><span class=\"discussion-id-72dcdd32-995e-4fbc-a0e9-6a64694411be notion-enable-hover\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"0\">Example 1: Random Allocation Mechanism</span><!-- notionvc: 1d82c55f-9144-4846-bfb8-0bf6cd15bbcb --></strong></p>\n<p>Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, and 2000 players submit their entries.</p>\n<p>1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward.</p>\n<p>The remaining 500 rewards are randomly distributed among the 1000 approved players who weren't the fastest to submit. <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red80\">Each of these remaining players has a 50% chance of receiving a reward.</span></p>\n<p><br><strong>Example 2: Even Distribution Mechanism<br></strong></p>\n<p>Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, totalling a prize pool of $1500. 2000 players have submitted their entries.<br><br>1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward.</p>\n<p>After distributing $1000 to the fastest players, $500 remains in the prize pool. This remaining amount is then evenly divided among the remaining 1000 approved players who have not received a reward yet. Consequently, <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red80\">each of these players will receive 50 cents.<br><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HQMNKXFTJ96995M7S5N92SQ2\">\n<strong><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\">FAQs<br></span></strong><!-- notionvc: 5896f8c9-cec4-4b8e-a90d-f7ffff7adf2d -->\n</h3>\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0How will I know if I am one of the fastest players to receive a reward?</strong><br>Your quest status will be \u2018rewarded\u2019 and you can also view your reward in your list of transactions on the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red80\" style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\"Balance &amp; Request History\" </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black70\" style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">page found under</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red80\" style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"> \"My Balance\".</span><!-- notionvc: 6dfa1df7-0399-4dbc-a8b8-7c3ad9f0ffd2 --></p>\n<p><strong>2.
